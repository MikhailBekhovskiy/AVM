# AVM
Program for Master's thesis
The work can be roughly divided in following stages:
1. Creating framework for multivariable polynomial symbolic algebra (including symb. derivatives) (fine-tuned for this project)
2. Implementing Additional Variables Method algorithms for multivariable functions and PDE systems (introduced by late L. K. Babadzhanyants)
3. Designing and implementing AVM Library of functions
4. Create GUI
