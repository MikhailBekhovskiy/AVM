# AVM
Program for Master's thesis
The work can be roughly divided in following stages:
1. Creating framework for multivariable polynomial symbolic algebra (including symb. derivatives) (fine-tuned for this project)
2. Implementing Additional Variables Method algorithms for multivariable functions and PDE systems (introduced by late L. K. Babadzhanyants)
3. Designing and implementing AVM Library of functions
4. Create GUI\  
References to be added.


Currently program works for transforming systems of functions and calculating their 1st order symbolic derivatives. Your input system has to be described in 'scrolls/[input_file]' in a fashion similar to examples (input_small, input_big). 
NB! F mode, independent variables explicitly specified and blank line at an end currently (user-friendliness is not a priority ATM). Readme will be updated as needed.
